# Open-Pull
This are all the files you need to build your own DIY Universal test machine.
# Build one
## CAD
CAD files of the whole assembly are available as stl, step and Fusion360 files.
## Electronics
Currently the electronics are only as schematics and as images. I'd be happy if anyone made a PCB design for it for easier use.
## Software
Software is currently only the Arduino code for the machine itself and very rudamentary and not optimized. Everything is controlled via the serial terminal.
#Run one
